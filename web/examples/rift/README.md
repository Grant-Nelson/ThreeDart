# 3Dart Rift

The consept for Rift has not been finalized.
This is a design and try out type game which will be directed by feedback.

## Story Notes

- Wake up and lab looks like an explosion has occurred
- Rifts open and things come out (enemies or friends)
- Could heads toward a H.P.Lovecraft style with tenticals coming from the rifts

## Design Ideas

- Torn lab coat scientest main character
- Foreground beakers causing destortion of the stage
- Stage causing distortion of background
- Background made of several layers
- Low laying fog on stage
- Can use large assets and small assets which tile
- Not survival, NPCs drop health and items

## Pillars

- Super Metroid style movement, jumping, breathing, etc
- Look and feel from 70's science and half-life 1
- Isolated, not a hero, becomes a hero by doing what it right
